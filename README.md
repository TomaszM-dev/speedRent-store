My coolest project yet is a website where you can rent cars, just like in real life. All the info on the site comes from the SpeedRental admin dashboard. You can pick a vehicle that's ready to roll, choose how long you want it, and pay for that time. Plus, I added lots of fun animations to make it cool! ðŸš—âœ¨
